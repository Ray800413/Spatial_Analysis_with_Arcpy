## Objective & Purpose
The objective of this project is to create a utilitarian Python script for use with ArcGIS. The purpose is to walk through traditional spatial analysis workflow using programming language instead of using ArcGIS GUI interface.  

## How to run it locally
1. Make sure you have ArcGIS Pro installed on your local machine or have the environmental file that can run Arcpy. 
2. Clone this repo to your local machine.
3. Given the file size limitation, please contact me through qray800413@gmail.com to get the data. Put the data into the same directory with the **index.ipynb**.
4. Activate your environment and then open the **index.ipynb** to run the code.
